# Flopify üéµ
(flop-ify)
Do you listen to the top 100 songs on iTUNES or the radio? Have you ever heard of those non-popular songs? This repo was created to provide listeners with a finer appreciation of quality music by giving them the worst.
This repository is the back-end API of a music streaming site. Only this repo creates music for listeners where Bands, Albums and Tracks are disliked the most, hence music that flopped. 

Installation
Create a repository folder. Pull down the repo in your own folder. You can run the program by opening up the solution in Visual Studio.
